# GoBox: Timeboxing with Git Accountability

## What is GoBox?

GoBox is a simple CLI tool written in Go that supports a basic timeboxing workflow for tasks in Markdown files. It works with your Git repository to log commits made during a work session, helping you review your progress without any fuss.

## ‚ú® Goals

* **Improve Focus:** Support dedicated work on a single task for a set duration.
* **Track Accountability:** Provide a record of Git commits associated with timeboxed sessions.
* **Manage Scope:** The visibility of commits within a timebox can help in staying focused on the task's defined scope.
* **Integrate Workflow:** Connect task management with existing Markdown notes and Git practices.

## üåü High-Level Features

* **Markdown Checklist Parsing:** Reads Markdown files to identify checklist items (`- [ ]` or `- [x]`).
* **Timebox Syntax Recognition:** Interprets timebox definitions per task, such as `@1h30m`.
* **Interactive Timer:** Initiates a timer for the next available task, counting down until completion or user input.
* **Git Integration:** Monitors the local Git repository and displays new commits as they occur during the active timebox.
* **Automated Markdown Update:** Upon task completion, `GoBox` performs the following updates to the Markdown file:
  * Checks the task's box (`- [x]`).
  * Appends a completion timestamp and the actual duration spent.
  * Lists all Git commits made during the timeboxed session directly under the task.
